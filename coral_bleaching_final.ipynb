    "I made some key decisions here, which I may revisit after training and scoring the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I chose only one indicator of location. Whereas the original data breaks down location a variety of ways, including by ocean, by nearest country, by ecoregion, and by latitude and longitude, I have chosen to keep only one: Realm_Name- a categorical variable with 8 distinct values. I believe this feature strikes the best balance between specificity and simplicity. Some of the other location columns have 100+ categories! Having more than one location-based features would assign bias since this information will obviously cross-correlate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I have chosen to proceed with only the Date_Year column among the time information. I am not hoping to develop a time-series model so I fear including data to the day will risk overfitting. In a future iteration, I may use the Date_Month column as a proxy for season, or engineer a season column from it. I suspect that we will see an increase in coral bleaching over time, and hope that the year will capture that. Going forward, I may attempt to develop a time-series model that incorporates date-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also decided to drop Substrate_Name and Percent_Cover since they are missing so many values and have poor correlation with the target. "
